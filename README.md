#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.

Software engineering is critical to the technology industry because it allows for the development of software applications and systems that power many parts of modern life, such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages and establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   -Requirements: Gathering and documenting user and system requirements.
   - Design: Create high-level and detailed designs for the software architecture and user interface.
   - Implementation: Writing code and developing software in accordance with the design specifications.
   - Testing: Running numerous tests to confirm that the software fulfills quality and functional criteria.
   - Deployment: Making the software available to users or customers.
   - Maintenance: Providing continuing software support, updates, and enhancements following deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is great for projects that have clear, established criteria and a predictable end such as large-scale construction projects, complex engineering designs, government projects with strict regulations, and software development with established functionalities where significant changes are not expected  , whereas Agile is best for initiatives that demand flexibility, collaboration, and quick feedback for example developing a new mobile app, launching a marketing campaign, designing a website with frequent updates, building a complex software system with evolving features, and prototyping a new product where customer feedback is crucial.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   - Software Developer: Writes code and implements software solutions.
   - Quality Assurance Engineer: Creates and executes test programs to ensure software quality.
   - Project Manager: Responsible for the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   - Changing Requirements: Requirements might change during the development cycle, causing scope creep and project delays.
   - Tight Deadlines: The pressure to produce software solutions on time can lead to hasty development and reduced quality.
   - Technical Debt: Accumulated through shortcuts or inadequate solutions, technical debt can stymie future development attempts and raise maintenance expenses.

 Effective communication, agile techniques, work prioritization, and continuous evaluation of project goals and timeframes are all examples of challenge-overcoming strategies.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about designing questions or assertions to elicit the optimal results from AI models. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague propmt-"What is the origin of the people in Kenya?"
Improved prompt-"What is the origin of the people living in western part of kenya?"
The improved prompt is very clear, specific and concise thus more effective.
